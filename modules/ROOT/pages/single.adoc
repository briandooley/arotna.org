= Release Notes

Imagine the perfect release notes, they informm the user with good news, bad news, <x>
where x is total gibberish to the user, <y> is really pertinent information to the user delivered in time for the user to react, and <z>. <z> would have been really pertinent to user but was learned by support and put in the release notes in the vain hope that anyone ends up in the exact co-ordinates of that unfortunate user.
Oh, I forgot, the 'perfect release' notes, so remove <z>, right?

Is that the pipeline of release notes to the first approximation?
