= JavaScript and Asciidoc

Antora is not the only use of JavaScript to render AsciiDoc. 
You can also use https://github.com/finp/siteless[siteless] to publish the master branch of your repo using GitHub pages.

NOTE: In this case, AsciiDoc is converted to HTML in the browser, so there is no build step.
